# React-Native Mobile Development
__This is the repo of the mobile app front-end of the PRS Request System.__

If you are interested in also contributing just issue a pull request with 
your changes/additions.

Here is a good tutorial for getting started with react-native.

https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html

This should get you up and running with your first Hello World app and
should allow you to pull the repo and run it. If you want to avoid installing 
android studio you can follow this link to use your phone for testing.

Now your phone can be used for testing and if you set it up right it 
will update as you save changes to your code.

If you have issues post them in the issues tab of the repository and I'll do my best to find a fix.

Feel free to hit me up with any questions you have.
